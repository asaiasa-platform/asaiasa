# ASAiASA Web Platform: Backend Development Stack

## Overview
The backend of the ASAiASA web platform is engineered for performance, scalability, and maintainability. It leverages Golang and adheres to clean code architecture principles to ensure robust and efficient service delivery.

## 1. Golang as the Core Language
- **Performance**: Golang (Go) is chosen for its high performance, concurrency support, and efficient memory management, making it ideal for scalable web services.
- **Simplicity**: The language's simplicity and strong typing reduce bugs and improve code readability.

## 2. Clean Code Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: The backend is structured into layers (domain, use case, interface, infrastructure) to promote modularity and testability.
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture ensures that business logic is decoupled from frameworks and external agencies, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

## 3. API Design & Best Practices
- **RESTful APIs**: The backend exposes RESTful APIs for all core functionalities, following best practices for resource naming, versioning, and error handling.
- **Testing & Documentation**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests, along with API documentation using tools like Swagger.
